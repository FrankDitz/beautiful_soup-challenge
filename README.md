# beautiful_soup-challenge
A full web-scraping and data analysis project that uses knowledge of HTML to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.
Super cool project and relatively straightforward. Didn't need much help on this one but incredible concept.
